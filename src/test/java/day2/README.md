# Note Day 2 

The Strength of RestAssured is method chaining to make all part of providing additional information before sending request , sending the request and verifying the response on one shot in BDD style of method chaining as below 

The Structure of RestAssured Method Chaining
```
given() ....   --> RequestSpecification 
     .header  accept() contentType()
     .queryParam
     .pathParam
     .body
     .log
     .auth..
when()       --->> RequestSender
   .get() ------>> Response Object 
   .post()
   .put()
   .delete()
then()      -----> ValidatableResponse  
        This is where assertion happen 
    .statusCode
    .header   accept() contentType()
    .body( matchers goes here)
    .log

```
Previously we have sent a get request to 
`GET /spartans/16` to get the data with spartan_id of 16. the number 16 here in rest api term is `path parameter|variable`

As above example of chaining , we can provide such information in `given` section of the chain

In Spartan app we can also ask for json result explicitly by providing `accept` header which can also be provided in `given` section

Below example show how it can be done in one Statement
```java
Response r1 =
        given()         // return RequestSpecification until when section start
                .header("Accept", "application/json")
                .pathParam("spartan_id",16).
        when()          // RequestSender
                .get("/spartans/{spartan_id}")  // return Response Object
                .prettyPeek()
        ;
```

RestAssured has strong support for common headers like `ContentType` and `Accept` by providing ready methods 

Above way of providing path parameter can be simplified as below by directly providing it in `get` method
```java
Response r2 =
given()
// this is same as .header("Accept", "application/json")
    .accept("application/json").
when()
// This is alternative way of providing
// path variable and value directly in get method
    .get("/spartans/{spartan_id}" , 16 )
    .prettyPeek() ; //return same response object after printing ,optional 
```
